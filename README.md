The idea here is to separate the view apresentation from the logic behind it. Using protocols to control the view interaction to the presenter and the necessary view updates from the presenter logic. It is faster to Test than MVC, allowing to test the view presentation and the view logic separatly.

This is a helper to create both, View Controller and it's Presenter, just adding the Name from the new UIViewController class.
